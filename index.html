                <p>Coffee lovers around the world who reach for their favorite morning brew probably arenâ€™t thinking
                    about its health benefits or risks. And yet this beverage has been subject to a long history of
                    debate. In 1991 coffee was included in a list of possible carcinogens by the World Health
                    Organization. By 2016 it was exonerated, as research found that the beverage was not associated with
                    an increased risk of cancer; on the contrary, there was a decreased risk of certain cancers among
                    those who drink coffee regularly once smoking history was properly accounted for. Additional
                    accumulating research suggests that when consumed in moderation, coffee can be considered a healthy
                    beverage.</p>

                <h2>Coffee bean</h2>

                <p>A coffee bean is a seed of the Coffea plant and the source for coffee. It is the pip inside the red
                    or purple fruit often referred to as a cherry. Just like ordinary cherries, the coffee fruit is also
                    a so-called stone fruit. Even though the coffee beans are not technically beans, they are referred
                    to as such because of their resemblance to true beans. The fruits; cherries or berries, most
                    commonly contain two stones with their flat sides together. A small percentage of cherries contain a
                    single seed, instead of the usual two. This is called a "peaberry". The peaberry occurs only between
                    10% and 15% of the time, and it is a fairly common (yet scientifically unproven) belief that they
                    have more flavour than normal coffee beans. Like Brazil nuts (a seed) and white rice, coffee beans
                    consist mostly of endosperm.</p>

                <h2>Lets try to make a coffee</h2>
                <p>How do you make coffee with milk?
                    To make instant coffee with milk instead of water, you have to heat your milk in a kettle. Add
                    instant coffee granules to your coffee cup and some sugar (if you must). Once the milk is hot
                    enough, pour it into that mug and stir well until coffee and sugar are completely dissolved. Your
                    instant milk coffee is ready.</p>

                <h1>Espresso</h1>
                
                <p>Also known as a short black, an espresso is a single shot of coffee. No extra hot water is added, resulting in an intense and flavoursome drink.

                    An espresso shot, which forms the basis of many of the other drinks to follow, is produced by forcing hot water through finely ground coffee beans.</p>

                <h1>Doppio</h1>

                <p>A Doppio is a double shot of espresso with no added hot water or milk. This results in 60 ml of coffee. Doppio means 'double' in Italian.</p>

                <h1>Ristretto</h1>
                
                <p>A ristretto, which means 'restricted' in Italian, is a shot of espresso coffee but extracted with half the amount of water. This results in a delicious, concentrated shot. A ristretto is typically enjoyed straight but it can also be combined with milk.</p>

                <h1>Long Black</h1>
                
                <p>A long black is made by pouring a double-shot of espresso over hot water. Unlike an Americano which is made by adding hot water to the espresso shot, a long black retains the crema and is less voluminous, therefore more strongly flavoured.</p>
